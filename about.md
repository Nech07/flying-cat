<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>This blog collects reading notes, implementation sketches, and key questions that arise as I work through papers across machine learning and adjacent fields. Each post follows a consistent structure so that I can revisit ideas quickly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Paper metadata:</strong> title, authors, venue, year, and handy links to the PDF, project page, or code.</li>
  <li><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> the three to five insights I want to remember.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep dive:</strong> implementation details, derivations, or experiments worth replicating.</li>
  <li><strong>Further reading:</strong> threads to pull on next--from follow-up papers to repos.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to fork the repo and adapt the layout for your own notes. Keeping the structure lightweight makes it easy to publish regularly while still capturing the context needed later.</p>
